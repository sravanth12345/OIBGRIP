        <h3>Donations and Charity</h3>
        <p class="business-p">As the richest man in the world, much light is shed on Elon Musk and how he spends his $220 billion fortune. We know Musk was willing to hand over $44 billion to purchase Twitter, a deal he is now attempting to back out of and allocated about $5.7 billion to spend on charity.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>When it comes to Musk and donating to charities, things don’t always seem as clear-cut as they do with other high-net-worth individuals.</li>
                  <li>While Musk appeared to be in the giving spirit when he reportedly donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to go to charities, it doesn’t mean the money actually went to support a cause.</li>
                  <li>You see, Musk’s $5.74 billion went to a donor-advised fund (DAF), according to Barrons, which acts as a separate fund or account specifically designed to hold contributions made by a donor.</li>
                  <li>Once money is placed in a DAF, the organization assigned to oversee it possesses legal control over it and is able to distribute the funds as it deems appropriate.</li>
                  <li>Essentially, what this means is that when a person like Musk donates money to a DAF but isn’t yet sure where they want the money to go, it can sit for years. </li>
                  <li>And by mid-March 2022, that appeared to have been the case with Musk’s generous contribution.</li>
                  <li>According to Fortune, by this time, it still wasn’t clear whether Musk’s donation had left the DAF. No nonprofits had come forward claiming they had received money from Tesla’s CEO.</li>
                  <li>Though it isn’t clear who will benefit from the billions Musk pledged to donate, we do know he initially put Igor Kurganov, 34, in charge of overseeing the money, reported The Wall Street Journal.</li>
